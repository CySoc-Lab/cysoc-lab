### About us
We are a group of interdisciplinary researchers specializing in cybercrime and social computing. Our lab's focus is dynamic and diverse, reflecting the rapidly evolving landscape of digital threats and social interactions online. Currently, much of our research centers on advanced data analytics and machine learning techniques applied to cybersecurity challenges and online social phenomena.

### Research
Our work spans several key areas:

0. Cybercrime Analysis: We investigate patterns of online criminal behavior, developing tools and methodologies to detect, track, and prevent various forms of cybercrime.
0. Social Network Dynamics: Our team explores how information and influence spread through online social networks, with particular attention to the propagation of misinformation and malicious content.
0. AI for Cybersecurity: We leverage deep learning and other AI techniques to enhance threat detection, automate defense mechanisms, and predict emerging cyber risks.
0. Digital Forensics: Our researchers develop cutting-edge methods for collecting and analyzing digital evidence related to cybercrimes.
0. Online Behavior Modeling: We study user behavior in digital environments to understand vulnerabilities, improve security measures, and enhance online safety.
0. Ethical Computing: Our lab is committed to exploring the ethical implications of social computing and cybersecurity technologies, promoting responsible innovation in these fields.


The best way to get a sense of what's currently going on in the lab is to check out the work of individual lab members.

### Lab Members

### Lab Culture

Our Cybercrime and Social Computing Lab is an ideal environment for curious, agile thinkers who thrive on rapidly exploring and synthesizing new ideas. Rather than following a single overarching project, each team member leads their own research initiatives within our broader mission.
We've developed several practices to ensure effective communication and collaboration:

0. Weekly 'Cyber Insights': A team member presents on a relevant topic, technique, or recent development in cybercrime or social computing.
0. 'Network Node': Our version of tea time. It's a 10-minute talk by a team member about anything related to their current work, recent findings, or interesting developments in the field.
0. Code Reviews: These sessions focus on sharing and improving our technical implementations.

Our lab practices are fluid and democratic. We regularly review and vote on new initiatives to keep our research environment dynamic and responsive to the ever-changing landscape of cybercrime and social computing.
